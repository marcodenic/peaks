### Controls

| Key                    | Action                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit                                           |
| `p` / `Space`          | Pause/Resume monitoring                        |
| `r`                    | Reset chart and statistics                     |
| `s`                    | Toggle statusbar visibility                    |
| `m`                    | Toggle between split axis and overlay modes    |
| `l`                    | Cycle through scaling modes (Linear → Log → √) |
| `t`                    | Cycle time scale (1/3/5/10/15/30/60 minutes)   |

### Display Modes

- **Split Axis Mode** (default) - Upload below, download above the central axis
- **Overlay Mode** - Both charts overlaid from bottom with yellow overlap indication

### Scaling Modes

- **Linear** - Traditional linear scaling where chart height is proportional to bandwidth
- **Logarithmic** (default) - Compresses large spikes while preserving detail for smaller values
- **Square Root** - Middle ground between linear and logarithmic scaling

### Time Scales

Choose from 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes of history display. The tool always maintains up to 60 minutes of data internally.

## � Installation

### Prerequisites

- A terminal with Unicode and color support

### Using Go (Recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/marcodenic/peaks@latest
```

### Manual Download

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/marcodenic/peaks/releases)
2. Download the binary for your platform
