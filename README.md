## üñ•Ô∏è Screenshots

The tool displays:
- Real-time split-axis braille chart with upload below and download above the axis
- Current bandwidth rates in the footer
- Optional statistics panel with uptime, peaks, and totals
- Live/paused status indicator
- Beautiful color-coded interface with clear traffic separation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With
- **[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)** - The Elm Architecture for Go TUI apps
- **[Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)** - Style definitions for terminal layouts
- **[Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles)** - Common UI components
- **[gopsutil](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil)** - Cross-platform system information

### Architecture
- `main.go` - Main application and Bubble Tea model
- `bandwidth.go` - Cross-platform bandwidth monitoring
- `chart.go` - Braille chart rendering with color overlays
- `ui.go` - Enhanced UI components and statistics

### Chart Rendering
The tool uses Unicode braille characters (U+2800‚ÄìU+28FF) for high-resolution terminal charts. Each character provides 8 dots in a 2√ó4 matrix, allowing for detailed visualization of bandwidth patterns.

### Color Mixing
When upload and download traffic overlap in the same chart position, the visualization intelligently blends colors to show yellow, indicating simultaneous activity.

## üé® Customization

The tool uses modern terminal colors and should work well with most terminal themes. Colors are automatically adapted based on your terminal's color support.

## üìä Performance

- Updates at 2 FPS for smooth, easy-to-follow visualization
- Minimal CPU usage through efficient rendering
- Maintains 1 minute of history by default
- Automatic scaling based on observed peak values

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Braille Characters Not Displaying
- Ensure your terminal font supports Unicode braille characters
- Try fonts like: Cascadia Code, Fira Code, or DejaVu Sans Mono
- On Windows, use Windows Terminal or a modern terminal emulator

### Colors Not Showing
- Verify your terminal supports ANSI colors
- Modern terminals (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Windows Terminal) should work fine
- Legacy terminals may show limited colors

### Permission Issues
- The tool only reads network interface statistics
- No special permissions required on most systems
- If issues persist, try running as administrator/sudo
