Great. I’ll research the most modern and effective way to create a real-time, terminal-based bandwidth monitoring tool using a braille-dot graph UI. I’ll focus on a Go-based implementation that uses Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, and any advanced terminal UX libraries that can deliver smooth visuals across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Once done, I’ll provide a clear, organized system planning prompt broken into tasks suitable for assignment to AI agents.


# System Plan: Cross-Platform Terminal Bandwidth Monitor

This plan outlines a modern approach to build a terminal-based bandwidth monitoring tool in Go. It will use the Charm TUI ecosystem for an efficient, cross-platform UI and provide real-time upload/download charts with an overlaid braille-dot graph.

## Tools and Libraries

* **Go (Golang)** – Chosen for its portability and performance. Go’s cross-platform capabilities ensure the tool runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with minimal changes. We will use Go modules for dependency management and a standard project layout for clarity.
* **Bubble Tea (Charmbracelet)** – A Go TUI framework based on the Elm Architecture, ideal for interactive terminal apps. Bubble Tea is production-tested, supports complex UIs, and includes performance optimizations like a framerate-based renderer for smooth updates. This helps achieve 10+ FPS rendering with minimal flicker.
* **Lip Gloss (Charmbracelet)** – A styling library for terminal layouts, used to define colors and layout in a declarative way. Lip Gloss complements Bubble Tea, making it simple to style text UI elements (colors, padding, etc.) without low-level ANSI handling. It ensures the upload/download text and chart can be colored (red, green, yellow) consistently across terminals.
* **gopsutil** – A cross-platform system info library for Go (port of Python’s psutil). Gopsutil abstracts OS differences and provides network I/O counters on all platforms. It avoids cgo and uses direct syscalls, making cross-compilation easy. We will use `gopsutil/net` to poll network byte counts for total upload/download across all interfaces.
* **Charm Bubbles & Others** – We will leverage Charm’s Bubbles components if needed (for example, a spinner or help menu) to enhance UX. While not strictly required for the core functionality, Bubbles provides reusable UI elements that integrate seamlessly with Bubble Tea. We will also keep Glamour (Markdown rendering) in mind for any rich text help documentation, though it’s not central to this monitoring tool. Additionally, we will consider the third-party **NTP Charts (`NimbleMarkets/ntcharts`)** library for terminal charts. It’s built on Bubble Tea and Lip Gloss and supports multi-line charts (time-series) using braille characters. This could accelerate development of the braille chart, though we may need to extend it for custom color-mixing of overlapping data points.

## Task 1: Environment Setup

1. **Project Initialization** – Set up a new Go module (e.g., `bandwidth-monitor-tui`). Create the initial directory structure and enable Go modules. For example: `go mod init github.com/youruser/bandwidth-monitor`.
2. **Dependency Installation** – Install required libraries:

   * `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` and `.../lipgloss` for the TUI framework and styling.
   * `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3` (or v4) for system metrics (particularly network I/O).
   * (Optional) `github.com/NimbleMarkets/ntcharts` if using the chart library for braille graphs.
     Use `go get` or update `go.mod` accordingly. This task ensures all libraries are in place and verifies that they build on all target platforms.
3. **Project Structure** – Establish a clear file structure. For a small project, a single `main.go` with internal packages for monitoring logic and TUI may suffice. If the project grows, consider a `cmd/` for the main program and packages like `ui` (for Bubble Tea model and view logic) and `monitor` (for bandwidth polling logic). Keeping code organized will aid future maintenance.

## Task 2: Core Bandwidth Polling Mechanism

* **Polling Strategy**: Implement a mechanism to continuously fetch system-wide network usage (bytes sent/received) at a fixed interval (\~100ms for \~10 FPS). Using gopsutil’s network I/O counters simplifies this. We will call `net.IOCounters(false)` to get an aggregate of all interfaces (the result with `Name: "all"`). This returns total bytes sent and received since boot.
* **Calculating Throughput**: Compute the difference in bytes sent/received between successive samples to get the bytes transferred in the last interval. Convert this to a rate (bytes per second). For display, convert bytes/sec to a human-friendly unit (e.g., Kbps, Mbps). For example, if 50,000 bytes were sent in 0.1s, that equates to 500,000 bytes/s (\~4 Mb/s) for the ↑ throughput.
* **Efficient Implementation**: Integrate this polling with Bubble Tea’s update loop. One approach is to use a `tea.Tick` or `tea.Timer` command that fires every 100ms, which triggers a message containing the latest bandwidth readings. This avoids spawning goroutines manually and lets Bubble Tea schedule updates at the desired frame rate. The update function will handle these tick messages by updating the model’s state (upload/download speeds and history data for the chart).
* **Accuracy & Edge Cases**: Account for counter resets or rollovers. If `BytesSent` or `BytesRecv` decreases on a subsequent call (e.g., counter rollover or interface reset), handle it by resetting the baseline to the new value. Typically, gopsutil uses 64-bit counters which won’t overflow under normal operation, but it’s good to guard against anomalies. Also, choose whether to monitor all interfaces combined or a specific interface; by default, “all” gives total system bandwidth which meets the requirement of *system-wide* monitoring.

## Task 3: Data Normalization and Unit Handling

* **Normalization for Chart**: Determine how to scale the raw throughput values to fit the chart’s range. The braille chart will have a limited vertical resolution (4 dot rows per character if using one text row for the chart). We need to map actual throughput (which could range from a few Kbps to hundreds of Mbps) into this range. This could involve using a logarithmic scale for very large ranges or simply scaling linearly to the max observed value. As the program runs, track the peak values or use a fixed maximum (e.g., if the user’s link is known, use that as 100%).
* **Throughput Units**: Implement a utility to format bytes/sec into human-readable strings for the footer (e.g., “430 Kbps” or “1.2 Mbps”). This function should choose appropriate units (KB/s, MB/s, or Kb/s vs Mb/s) and format to a couple of significant figures. It can reside in the `monitor` package (e.g., `FormatBandwidth(bps uint64) string`). Testing this function with various values will ensure correctness (e.g., 12345678 bytes/sec should show as \~94.1 Mbps).
* **Smoothing (if needed)**: Decide if any smoothing of data is required for the chart. A moving average or low-pass filter could stabilize the graph if raw readings are too jittery, but this is optional. Given a \~0.1s interval, instantaneous throughput might fluctuate; a simple approach is to average the last few samples for the displayed value. However, to keep it real-time and responsive, we likely will display raw differences per tick and rely on the high refresh rate to naturally smooth perception.
* **Data Buffer for Chart**: Maintain a rolling buffer of recent throughput samples (both upload and download). For example, store the last N seconds of data (N \* 10 samples if 10 fps). This data array will be used for rendering the chart. When new data comes in, append it and drop the oldest to keep the length fixed. This ensures the chart slides over time, showing recent history.

## Task 4: Braille Chart Rendering

* **Chart Dimensions**: Design the chart to be an overlaid sparkline of upload/download using braille characters. Braille Unicode cells (U+2800 – U+28FF) offer a 2x4 dot matrix per character, effectively giving a higher vertical resolution in one text row. We will likely render one line of braille characters that continuously updates (like an inline graph).
* **Mapping Data to Braille Dots**: Implement a function to map the buffered data points into braille characters. Each braille char has 8 possible dot positions (4 vertical levels × 2 horizontal positions). We can assign one horizontal column to upload and the other to download at each time step. For instance:

  * Use the left 4-dot column of each cell for upload data and the right 4-dot column for download data. Each dot’s row corresponds to a value level (after normalization into 4 levels).
  * Alternatively, treat each braille cell as representing two time steps (as done in some sparkline implementations), where the left column is the earlier sample and right column the later sample. However, to overlay upload/download, it’s clearer to use left vs. right for the two datasets at the same time point.
* **Drawing the Graph**: Iterate through the recent data arrays. For each time index, determine the normalized level (0–3, where 0 = no activity, 3 = max) for upload and download. Set the corresponding braille dot in the char:

  * Braille dot indexing: dot1–dot4 are the first column top-to-bottom, dot5–dot8 second column. If upload has level 2 and download level 3 at a time, we would set (for that character) the dot in left column at row 2 and right column at row 3.
  * Use bitmasks or a lookup table for braille dots. For example, define constants for each dot’s bit in the Unicode braille character (0x2800 plus bit pattern). We can bitwise-OR the bits for upload and download to get the combined braille character.
* **Library Utilization**: Optionally use `ntcharts` or similar if it can be adapted. For instance, `ntcharts/linechart` can plot multiple datasets and has a `DrawBraille()` method for high-resolution output. We could feed our data into that library’s data structures and retrieve a braille-rendered string. This might handle the heavy lifting of scaling and plotting. However, we must verify it supports drawing two datasets in one chart with distinct styles. The library allows adding datasets via `PushDataSet()` and setting styles per dataset. We could set upload’s style to red, download’s to green. The combined output from `ntcharts` might not directly produce a mixed-color overlap (it will likely stack or overwrite characters), so we may still need to post-process overlap coloring.

## Task 5: Overlay Logic and Color Mixing

* **Overlay Determination**: Develop logic to detect where upload and download data points coincide in the chart. In our braille rendering, “overlap” means a single braille character has contributions from both upload and download (i.e. both left and right column dots in at least one of the 4 rows are filled). When constructing each braille cell, track whether it contains an upload dot, a download dot, or both.
* **Color Assignment**: Use **Lip Gloss** (or Bubble Tea’s builtin styling via ANSI) to color the output string. We will create styles:

  * Red for upload-only segments,
  * Green for download-only,
  * Yellow for points where both overlap.
    Because a single braille character can’t be split into two colors, if a char has any overlap (dots from both series), we’ll render that whole character in yellow. If a char has only an upload dot or only a download dot, color it in red or green respectively. This color mixing rule ensures overlapping traffic is visually distinct.
* **Implementing Coloring**: In practice, as we build the braille string, we can append segments with the appropriate Lip Gloss style. For example:

  ```go
  var sb strings.Builder
  for each char in chartCells {
      if char.hasUpload && char.hasDownload {
          sb.WriteString(yellowStyle.Render(char.rune))
      } else if char.hasUpload {
          sb.WriteString(redStyle.Render(char.rune))
      } else if char.hasDownload {
          sb.WriteString(greenStyle.Render(char.rune))
      } else {
          sb.WriteString(" ") // no data
      }
  }
  graphLine := sb.String()
  ```

  Define `redStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(lipgloss.Color("9"))` (assuming palette color 9 is red) and similarly for green (color "10") and yellow ("11" or a mix).
* **Verification**: Test the overlay coloring by simulating scenarios:

  * Upload only (should see only red dots).
  * Download only (only green).
  * Both with different magnitudes (both colors visible, no yellow unless they coincide in the same char).
  * Both with similar values at same time (likely causing overlap in many cells, should turn those cells yellow).
    The color output can be tested in a truecolor-supported terminal for clarity. Lip Gloss will auto-detect and downgrade colors if needed (e.g., on Windows CMD which might not support full 24-bit).

## Task 6: Status Footer Display

* **Footer Content**: Implement a footer line that shows real-time numeric throughput values. For example: `"↑ 430 Kbps | ↓ 1.2 Mbps"`. This line should update every tick with the latest calculated upload and download rates.
* **Layout and Styling**: Use Lip Gloss to style the footer distinctly (perhaps a dimmer color or inverse background to set it apart). Ensure the arrows and units are consistently formatted. The upload arrow (↑) and download arrow (↓) can be included using Unicode symbols. We might color the arrows themselves (red for ↑, green for ↓) to match the chart lines, and the numeric values in default or white text for readability. For overlap (yellow) we don't explicitly show a number, as the overlap is visual in the chart only.
* **Positioning**: If the tool runs full-screen (Bubble Tea can use full terminal screen), the footer can be a fixed bottom line. If it’s a small inline widget, the footer can directly follow or precede the chart line. Using Lip Gloss’s layout utilities (if needed) or simple newline separation will suffice. For example, the `View()` function of the Bubble Tea model might return `graphLine + "\n" + footerLine`.
* **Dynamic Unit Adjustment**: If the throughput goes above 999 Mbps, consider switching to Gbps in the display. The formatting utility from Task 3 should handle this. This ensures the footer remains concise (no long numbers) and always has units that make sense.

## Task 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility

* **Ensure OS Compatibility**: Because we rely on gopsutil for metrics, the heavy lifting of cross-platform support is done for us. Still, test the polling on each OS:

  * **Linux**: gopsutil reads from `/proc/net/dev` or similar. Test on a Linux machine (or container) that the tool picks up interface stats and that “all” includes all traffic. No special privileges should be needed for reading basic net stats.
  * **macOS**: gopsutil will likely use syscalls or sysctl to get network bytes. Verify on macOS that it reports correct values. Pay attention to whether it counts both Wi-Fi and Ethernet if both are connected (the “all” aggregate should cover all). No code changes expected, but ensure color output works in the macOS Terminal (Lip Gloss auto-detects color support).
  * **Windows**: gopsutil uses Windows performance counters or IP Helper API. Test on Windows (possibly via cross-compiling and running, or using WSL for Linux testing then a Windows native run). Ensure that the terminal (likely Windows Terminal or PowerShell) displays the braille characters properly. Windows may need a TrueType font that supports braille Unicode; document that as a requirement. Also, verify color output on Windows terminal (modern Windows 10+ terminals support ANSI colors, but older cmd might not without `EnableVirtualTerminalProcessing`). Bubble Tea’s default renderer should handle enabling ANSI mode on Windows automatically.
* **Terminal Size Adaptation**: The tool should detect terminal width to decide how many characters of the graph to show. Bubble Tea provides the terminal size via the `Init` msg or can subscribe to `windowSizeMsg`. Plan to handle a window resize event – adjust the length of the data buffer or wrapping of output accordingly. This ensures the UI remains properly sized on all platforms and terminal sizes.
* **Resource Usage**: Running at \~10 FPS polling and rendering is lightweight, but confirm that CPU usage remains low on each platform. The cross-platform code should use efficient operations (gopsutil calls are quick, and our rendering is string/buffer manipulation). We avoid curses or heavy redraws, instead relying on Bubble Tea’s diffing and optimized renderer to minimize flicker and CPU load.
* **Alternative Language Consideration**: Since Go meets all requirements, we likely won’t use another language. We note that Rust could be an alternative for performance and cross-platform support, but it lacks an equivalent mature TUI toolkit like Charm’s (Rust has tui-rs, crossterm, etc., but integration wouldn’t be as straightforward as Bubble Tea). Given the strong Go ecosystem here, sticking with Go is the most effective approach.

## Task 8: Integration Testing and Refinement

* **Functional Testing**: Combine all components (poller, chart, UI) and run the application. Generate some known network traffic to see if the tool responds (for example, download a large file in the background and watch the download rate rise). Verify that the chart updates in near real-time and the footer values make sense (cross-check with an external tool like `iftop` or Task Manager to ensure accuracy).
* **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for key logic pieces:

  * The data normalization and formatting functions (given raw bytes, do we get correct Kbps/Mbps strings?).
  * The braille mapping function (feed in synthetic small data arrays and verify the Unicode output matches expected patterns or known Unicode code points for certain dot combinations).
  * Color logic (if a braille cell has both upload and download bits set, ensure the function marks it for yellow).
    These can be tested by directly calling the rendering functions with controlled inputs.
* **UI Snapshot Testing**: Since this is a TUI, an automated test might capture the output of the `View()` function for a known model state. For example, simulate the model with specific data (e.g., upload=50%, download=50% of scale) and ensure the view string contains the correct braille chars and color codes (ANSI sequences). This can catch regression in the rendering.
* **Cross-Platform Testing**: As a final verification, run the tool on each target OS:

  * On Linux and macOS terminals, check that the braille characters render properly (they should, as Unicode braille is widely supported in modern terminal fonts). Ensure color output looks correct (distinct red/green/yellow).
  * On Windows, run in Windows Terminal. Braille characters should appear (Windows Terminal with a font like Cascadia Mono supports them). If any characters appear as boxes, advise users to change font or fallback to an alternate rendering (as a contingency, we could implement a simpler ASCII graph if braille isn’t supported, but this is unlikely on modern systems).
* **Performance Tuning**: If the UI flickers or lags at higher frame rates, use Bubble Tea’s builtin FPS controls. The framework can limit the render rate; e.g., we might set the Bubble Tea program option `WithFPS(15)` to cap at 15 FPS if needed. However, Bubble Tea’s diffing renderer should handle frequent updates efficiently. Monitor CPU while running a high-throughput scenario; it should remain modest (a few percent).
* **User Experience Enhancements**: During integration, refine details like:

  * Clear labeling (maybe add a title or legend “Red=Up, Green=Down” at the top or as a help screen).
  * Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., press `q` to quit, Bubble Tea already supports Ctrl+C by default to exit).
  * Possibly allow toggling interfaces or pausing the graph.
    These are stretch goals, but a system planning AI can later assign tasks for such enhancements. The core deliverable is a smooth, visually clear bandwidth monitor running in the terminal.

By following these tasks, we will build a robust, modern TUI application for bandwidth monitoring. The combination of Go’s cross-platform libraries for system stats and Charm’s TUI framework will result in a responsive tool featuring a high-resolution braille graph overlay (red for upload, green for download, and yellow on overlap) with real-time throughput stats in a friendly text UI.
